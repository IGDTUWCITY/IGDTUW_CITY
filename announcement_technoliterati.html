<br><br>
Fair greetings to all tech brains with literary hearts!
<br><br>
Who's asking you to pick one of the two when they both strive for the same goal: to expand human horizons and set the imagination ablaze? Definitely not us! TechnoLiterati, the technical and literary society of IGDTUW, invites you to our orientation, where you'll discover how we blend the best of both worlds
<br><br>
We're all about sparking conversations, sharing ideas, and creating together, this is your space. Find fun workshops, cool events, and plenty of chances to connect with others who love both realms. Let's explore how tech and lit can push boundaries and inspire us to think differently. Look forward to an event packed with fun games and of course, prizes as well as refreshments for all attendees!
<br><br>
Date: 20th September 2024 (friday)
